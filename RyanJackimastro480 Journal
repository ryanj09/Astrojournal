#I read the white side journal and I found that I needed to put in all failed attempts into the paper. 
#Also, that the failed attempts go after the final conclution. 
#I didn't realize that the process started long before data was taken and 
#that I needed to build my argument around the data
#One thing I was very confused over was the three sections. 
#It said that there was only introduction, results, and conclution
#What about data analysis. I always see this in astronomical journals.

#I would like to note that during this coding, I was feveriously working on it. 
#Due to mental imparments, I was aware of what I was doing, but I was unaware of the code around me. 
#I tried my best over the weekend to observe the sky. It was cloudy each night I checked.

#4/04/2018. Worked on fitting and working code for the HW assignment.
#got most of the code writen and ran the first half. First half was completed without errors. 
#The moon is a big trouble for us. The declination is right on top of our mean value for the data point's dec.
#I have thought of this problem extensively, Firstly, its only on this spot on the first day, but since we are taking
#the differenece between first and last observations. I can do one of the following, create a for loop for each
#day and each position the moon will be in, ignore the moon, pick different points, or track the moon as it crosses
#the sky and make a for loop for moon seperations distance. 

#4/06/2018, Supercloudy week! No observations done. 
#Spent the entire day getting new data points as we learned that the data we had didn't have enough variation.
#Finished the code the class before and only freshened it up today.

#4/11/2018 Basics of observational observation.
#What do we want to know about the star. 
#We use mirrors to avoid harder aborations that we need to calculate.
#Apparent mag Luminosity need to know distance to the object because of apparent mag. f=1/d^2
#Resolution, R=wavelength/aperture. 
#Flux per unit wavelength, for spec.
#Working everywhere but were focusing on visible and may not work for the other bands.
#Filters block certain light so you can see what light is being made. 
#Lot of filters can be used for making low res spectrograph.
#differential vs absoulte photometry, both include comparison to another star.
#differential comparison to a star of unknown luminosity.
#absolute comparison to a star of known luminosity. Want star to be close to same magnitude.
#stars are not square like our detectors.Toss all partial pixels.could use those pixels(even though they will have sky)
#Could use a weighting scheme.
#Intervening materials. weather, dust, sky brightness, cranes, airmass.
#Histogram function is completely missing from DS9.

#4/13/2018 Worked on the fits files assignment. 
#The histograms function was missing from the ds9 and I was unable to do anything with histograms. 
#Been rainy all week and been unable to observe on any night. 
#Going to spend some time over the weekned looking at low mass star binaries. 

#4/16/2018 Spent little time looking at low mass binaries and instead opted to look for stars count in orion.
#The entire weekend was cloudy.
#ccd's and electronics on friday.
#the bias or overscan is the black bar in the center. At the edges it was fainter but still a good square.
#Scattered light at the black sections is from scattered lights.
#not all telescopes record ra and dec
#for the histograms we found in the hw problem:
#poisson distributions, gaussian distribution. We look at our regions and figure out whether it was poisson or gaussian
#65000 counts is the saturation of the ccd's were using.
#poisson = photon> independant (quasi)
#gaussian = variations in ccd readouts\electonics will cause a normal distribution around the bias level
#you can also calculate the read noise and gain from this histogram
#HCG is hickson compact group or galaxy cluster survey.
#Group been in the top right so that it is off the electronics.
#The dec and ra is slightly off because the telescope was slightly off because of above
#wash filter avoids skyline faint background.
#you lose extra light using a different filter in 1 observation, vs another, based on design. that's why apo images
#Might look different from flatfits file because of the optical path design, things may very. 
#detectors ccds: the collect then pass charges off. pixles are like buckets. When a bucket is full, it spills out
#into the other pixels. ccds count for the minutes you ask for. It doesn't know when a photon was hit, just that it did
#electrodes get charged and the charge gets carried on a silicon material to a computer.
#readouts take time. They read out one rows that falls, and one pixel at a time. 20-40s is a good readout time.
#Quantum efficency in %, how a ccd coverts photons into electricity. coatings of metal give far greater percentage.
#ccd's work at liquid nitrogen temps since they give lots of dark current since everything is moving in the atoms.
#dark current
#12-15 um pixels are a standard pixel detectors. with small pixels, they take longer to get pixels into the buckets.
#ccds are good because they are linear, pixels can saturate, gain is intrinsic, responsive in the optical fundamentally
#a material issues, ccds have become commercially viable.
#CMOS detectors reads out in each pixel. Issues around nose, heat and distance. because electronics fill pixel, image >
#Signal to noise, the lower the harder it is to idenfity what you're looking at. 
#ccds have several noise makers, short noise thermal, read noise bias. 
#too large of a signal to noise will make operations long and its expensive to run.
#Shot noise photons hit the chip and when they get there is dictated by poisson statistics 
#so you will not get the same number at a given time.

#Observed tonight and got an image of a few stars directly above me.I have not decomposed what I've seen yet.
#Managed to get through most of what you had assigned but was unable to complete. 

#4/20/2018 Completed the purposal and decided to go for observing and trying to understand yellow hypergiant IRC+10420
#This specific star is great for observing due to the shear amount of observation there is on it and it is
#Observed in the obtical. I'm concerned about witch spectra instrument to use at the APO telescope
#I am also concerned that I will not have enough for a 10 page paper. IRC+10420 is observable on the schedualed time
#My goal is to understand the propertiesandI'm concerned that I wont get enough info to know its more unique properties
#Rushed to work on the lab today.

#4/23/2018 Finished answering the questions on the fourth problem but did not write them up. 
#Observed tonight. Saw a few different stars since the last obvservation. For some reason I think I'm looking at the
#big dipper

#4/25/2018 Gia data catalog on variable stars has been made public.
#Project IRC 10420 spectra take, wolfray rey and AGB spectra to compare. IRC not visable when we can obvserve in apo
#We can take spectra using a never before use spectragraph here in the school. 
#Need to search for IRC counter parts that can be viewed in our observing time. 
#High resolution spectrograph to observe IRC
#By friday, need to find out how we are observing

#4/27/2018 Searched for substitutes to IRC 10420 and could only find them on the opposite side of the nightsky ie. 0ra
#IRC+10420 V and mag 11.66
#Potential AGB, NR Vulpeculae or V* NR Vul, V band mag 9.36
#Potential Wolf-Rayet stars WR 139 or HD 193576 Vband mag 8, WR 140or HD 193793 Vband mag 7.25, WR 147 or 
#EM* AS 431 Vband mag 14.89
#These magnitudes were what you asked me to sent to you to determine exposure time. Since I will have only two to
#three hours to observe each star. 
#Worked on getting the data for CCD in class. We have rather great data.

4/30/2018 Photometry. 
In a ccds we have to convert from analog to digital signals. ADC performs this operation. Read noise is the noise from the background and limitations of the ccd. Shot noise comes from the plison distributuin
Issues of the CCD's are from fixed power loop. We want shot noise limited and not read noise.
Data reduction and analysis. We can work backward from what has been added to the CCD after the phton is the bias.
Bias are sometimes called zero, but here they are known as almost zero. 
We subtract the bias because the read out is not based on a function of time. 
Flat fields, image is not perfectly flat flat. It is an image illuminated evenly by light.
This flat results in information about the pixel to pixel variaton. 
If you make a histogram of a flat field, it would be a gaussian distribution 
To use a flat field to flatten our observations- We divide our science observations by this.
Darks CCDs even when cooled generate a small amount of thermal current. This scales with time. Often it is a small effect and people skip darks. We skip dark current

5/02/2018 Worked more on completing the data reduction assianment. I got all the flats combined but I'm still working on how 
to get the overscan removed.

05/04/2018 I went to the A wing telescope and learned how to use it. Didn't manage to get any work done on the data reduction
Sorry for the late turn in. I was so focused on the telescope that I forgot this was due on friday. 

for my observation on monday, 1:30am should be the estimated time for when IRC will rise.

5/07/2018 Worked in class on the reducing data assignment. Got almost all of the way done with the circular annulus
Observed tonight at 1am. We were unable to figure out how to get the spectra graph to fit on the telescope so we could measure
spectra. Instead, we used ccd data of my targets.

5/09/2018 Worked at reducing data assignment. PSF photometry. 
The point spread function of a star is like a gaussian. So when we are doing point spread function fitting, its going to try 
to fit a gaussian function to our data. It gives us a greater ability since we can work with closely packed stars.
Not good for non point sources like galaxies. I will see all the stars rather than just my ten.

5/11/2018 Scientific paper. Approach, framework details. Approach, You are trying to answer a question or report a discovery
Reporting guided by reprodesebility. Tie into larger field contex.
framework, paper have sections: you don't need exactly these sections but this is the flow of information: introduction
methods/data results and discussion, conclusion/summary. Details: include/present you data this might mean data tubbles, plots 
or images. Include the theories and equations that you are using for your results and include assumptions.
Reference, your information comes from somewhere. Make sure to credit that works approprately. Plots and tables should:
be legiable, have captions and add references to them in the text. Legend is a good thing to do. When in doubt you should ask.
Managed to finish the PSF for the Reducing image data. YEAH!

5/14/2018 Worked on Usng Sdss survey data worksheet. I got all the way to making the color magnitude diagrams.
I was able to calculate the distance from the camera to the outer casing of the CCD as 4 cm and the lip that hold the ccd
on the telescope to be 1.5 cm. 

5/16/2018 Need to work on the final project and to look up an alternative. Currently, I have the introduction drafted but 
nothing else. I have a general layout made with references not intergrated. Cannot work on most of the discussion until I have
data. Make up a fake abstract to work in place of what I have now. Just make up what I want to find. 

For the lab today, I got most of my comparison data from:
http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/Radar/nph-estimation?mission=All&objstr=NGC++2682&mode=box&radius=0.413&radunits=deg&range=12.5+Deg.&data=Data+Set+Type&radnum=2222&irsa=IRSA+Only&submit=Get+Inventory&output=%2Firsa%2Fcm%2Fwebsite%2Firsa%2Fshare%2Fwsvc%2FRadar%2Fcatlist.tbl_type&url=%2Fworkspace%2FTMP_TmWZfL_12495&dir=%2Fwork%2FTMP_TmWZfL_12495&polygon=%40%B25J%9B%7F&snull=matches+only&datav=Data+Set+Type
Use code from: http://www.astropy.org/astropy-tutorials/Coordinates.html

5/18/2018 Worked on the paper. I have so far made only one page of 10p text that covers the entire introduction and had added 
little to other places due to the lack of data. Found backup spectra of IRC+10420 in case things go wrong. Found it for 
two different wavelengthers here http://cdsportal.u-strasbg.fr/?target=IRC%20%2B10420,
3mm: http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/vizExec/Vgraph?J/A+A/592/A51/10420_3mm.fits&,
1mm: http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/vizExec/Vgraph?J/A+A/592/A51/10420_1mm.fits&
Need to understand how to read these files becuase the axis makes little sense and is not copied over when downloaded.
I worked on the SDSS survey data 

5/21/2018 Scowered the internet and all sources I could think of to find spectral data on a yellow hypergiant. Found this site
that had data ready to download but couldn't figure out how to view the files
http://etacar.umn.edu/LuminousStars/M31M33/M33YSG.html
Got the idea to go here from this paper http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/773/1/46/pdf
Found this nice sheet of classifying spectral types
https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~pberlind/atlas/htmls/note.html
Managed to get your link to work and gathered the research document from this link
https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2017/05/aa29146-16.pdf

5/23/2018 Gave up on finding spectra of my target and instead found photometry from this link
https://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dss_form?target=IRC%2B10420&action=search&resolver=SIMBAD&radius=10.0
Plan on changing my research project to prodicting the extended atmosphere around IRC+10420
And 2 mass photometric data can be found at this link

Machine learning with python: look at chapter 5 of python data science handbook on canvas.
Running through some tutorials about machine learning. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html
working with text data http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html
work on one of the two assiangments.
machine learning is a way to build mathematcal models of data
a way to inform our models wiht our data *a tool for classification, identification studying clustered or continuous data.

5/25/2018 Desperately tried to gather enough content to fill 10 pages worth of text for my observation project.
Machine learning. Compueter programing: a set of instructions telling a computer hardward via a computer what to do.
Supervised learning: use training data to each the algorithm what inputs maps to what output, based on the training set.
here it matters what your sturcuture/algorithm is, but also decisisons made in creating your training data
Using unsupervised learning. No inputs or present categories or lables to match. this can both be useful in producing unbiased
information about a data set - but also s not constrained by your questions.(computers don't know physics)
naive bayes: good starting point, especially for well separated classes. Fast so easy to test. assumes everything s drawn from 
a gaussian distribution. 
One way to engage programming tutorials: first read through it. Don't copy the code, type them. Don't feel trapped by the
tutorial. If it fails, then find out why by using other tools like python or slack overflow. astrobetter. Read carefully.
Trust yourself and ask a friend. Sometimes tutorials could be wrong or broken in some way. 
Worked more on the machine learning lab. I'm working on the second page of the lab.
